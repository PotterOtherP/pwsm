In the Plant/Waste/Solution/Media lab, growers submit samples of agricultural materials (plant leaf tissue, animal waste, water-based solutions, or potting media)
to be analyzed for basic nutrient levels and other properties. With the results of these tests, recommendations are made for optimal production of the grower's
particular crops.

This app allows employees of the P/W/S/M lab to create electronic records for each sample submission, save them to a database, and generate a worklist showing all
laboratory tests that have been assigned to each sample.

The app is deployed here: https://potterotherp.github.io/pwsm/. This app is a work in progress, begun in January 2021.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
